chinese-character-counter
=========================

My first python script! 

Motivation for the script: Microsoft Word does not distinguish between Chinese (CJK) unicode punctuation and Chinese characters, leading to pesky issues when trying to count whether you have hit the word count for an essay for class! The python script takes an input of either a .txt or a .docx and spits out the number of Chinese (CJK) characters.
